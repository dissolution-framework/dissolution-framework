# Contributing to Dissolution Protocol

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Dissolution Protocol! This guide explains how you can help advance AI evaluation through symbolic cognition testing.

## Ways to Contribute

### üìä Test Results
Share your findings from testing different AI models. Your results help build understanding of how various systems handle symbolic reasoning.

**What to include:**
- Model name and version
- Test responses (full or summarized)
- Your evaluation/scoring
- Notable patterns or anomalies

### üìù Documentation Improvements
Help make the protocol clearer and more accessible:
- Clarify test instructions
- Add examples of good/bad responses
- Improve scoring explanations
- Fix typos or formatting issues

### üöÄ New Test Ideas
Propose additional tests that explore different aspects of symbolic cognition:
- Tests for specific domains (e.g., technical, creative, cultural)
- Edge cases or boundary conditions
- Novel evaluation criteria

### üîç Analysis & Insights
Share deeper analysis of the data:
- Cross-model comparisons
- Pattern identification
- Statistical analysis
- Domain-specific findings
